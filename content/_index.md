Hey :wave:

My name is Brandon Cardoso. I'm a software engineer and entrepeneur from Toronto :canada:, currently in Tokyo. I'm working on [Sentinowl](https://sentinowl.com) - a modern, lightweight, hardware monitoring tool.

This is my personal site where I write notes, ideas, and maybe some essays, about the things I'm interested in.
